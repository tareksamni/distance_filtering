We have some customer records in a text file (customers.json) -- one customer per line, JSON-encoded. 

We want to invite any customer within 100km of our office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

The GPS coordinates for our office are 53.3393,-6.2576841.

You can find the Customer list [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tareksamni/distance_filtering/master/customer.json).
